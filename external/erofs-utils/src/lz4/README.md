LZ4 - Extremely fast compression
================================

LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm,
providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core,
scalable with multi-cores CPU.
It features an extremely fast decoder,
with speed in multiple GB/s per core,
typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

Speed can be tuned dynamically, selecting an "acceleration" factor
which trades compression ratio for faster speed.
On the other end, a high compression derivative, LZ4_HC, is also provided,
trading CPU time for improved compression ratio.
All versions feature the same decompression speed.

LZ4 is also compatible with [dictionary compression](https://github.com/facebook/zstd#the-case-for-small-data-compression),
both at [API](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.8.3/lib/lz4frame.h#L481) and [CLI](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.8.3/programs/lz4.1.md#operation-modifiers) levels.
It can ingest any input file as dictionary, though only the final 64KB are used.
This capability can be combined with the [Zstandard Dictionary Builder](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.5/programs/zstd.1.md#dictionary-builder),
in order to drastically improve compression performance on small files.


LZ4 library is provided as open-source software using BSD 2-Clause license.

Benchmarks
-------------------------

The benchmark uses [lzbench], from @inikep
compiled with GCC v8.2.0 on Linux 64-bits (Ubuntu 4.18.0-17).
The reference system uses a Core i7-9700K CPU @ 4.9GHz (w/ turbo boost).
Benchmark evaluates the compression of reference [Silesia Corpus]
in single-thread mode.

Installation
-------------------------

```
make
make install     # this command may require root permissions
```

LZ4's `Makefile` supports standard [Makefile conventions],
including [staged installs], [redirection], or [command redefinition].
It is compatible with parallel builds (`-j#`).

### Building LZ4 - Using vcpkg

You can download and install LZ4 using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg.exe install lz4

The LZ4 port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

Documentation
-------------------------

The raw LZ4 block compression format is detailed within [lz4_Block_format].

Arbitrarily long files or data streams are compressed using multiple blocks,
for streaming requirements. These blocks are organized into a frame,
defined into [lz4_Frame_format].
Interoperable versions of LZ4 must also respect the frame format.

[lz4_Frame_format]: doc/lz4_Frame_format.md


Other source versions
-------------------------

Beyond the C reference source,
many contributors have created versions of lz4 in multiple languages
(Java, C#, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.).
A list of known source ports is maintained on the [LZ4 Homepage].

### Packaging status

Most distributions are bundled with a package manager
which allows easy installation of both the `liblz4` library
and the `lz4` command line interface.
